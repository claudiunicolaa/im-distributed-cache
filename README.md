# im-distributed-**cache**
### Another in-memory distributed cache. Why? Because...why not?

**Another in-memory distributed cache built for learning purposes** but feel free to use it on your projects if you think it can be useful.

The aim of it is to explore: 
- Go concurrency model
- Inter-communication between multiple servers (nodes)
- Add/remove server (node) from a cluster and re-balance the load
- Hashing mechanism to distribute the data between the nodes
- Benchmarking and performance optimization strategies

### Usage

*Work in progress*

*See [example/main.go](example/main.go) for usage*

### Testing

```bash
make test
```

### Benchmarking

```bash
make bench
```

#### Results
```bash
‚ùØ make bench
go test -bench=. ./...
